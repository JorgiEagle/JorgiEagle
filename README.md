A mix of personal and University projects, so far

## Spare time

I'm a massive video gamer, to the point where it is borderline unhealthy, and probably an addiction. Would love to get into modding, so watch this space. (Any recommendations are welcome)

Games I enjoy (in no particular order):

- OpenTTD
- Runescape (incl Oldschool)
- Factorio
- Anno
- The Division
- Minecraft
- Destiny (1)
- Age of Empires
- Halo
- Sniper Elite
- Dyson Sphere Program
